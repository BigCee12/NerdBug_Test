    subtitle: '''
This was a freelancing job I just concluded this month, it's a payment app that allows you to pay for your bills,data, and also transfer money to other banks,
though I was more of the UI developer with about 45% of the backend, I was able to learn alot about the payment system and how it works. 
This has to be the hardest project I have worked on so far, it encompasses alot of packages and functioanlities,used State management,Firebase, Camera, Image Picker,Geo Location, and lots more, It's still under production but I am done with my part.

and then introduced Riverpod as a state manager then 
finally moved it to Firebase. 
Basically used it to learn most of technologies I needed, thus it grew.''',
